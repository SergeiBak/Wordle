## Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic guessing game known as Wordle, which became so popular that it was purchased by the New York Times from the original creater for a seven-figure sum. This project was worked on as to fulfill one of my goals of becoming more familiar with front end / web development. It was created in Visual Studio Code using html, css, and javascript as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!   

Wordle consists of six 5-letter rows in which player's can enter their guesses. The goal of the game is to guess the secret word to win! A correct letter in the correct position will be outlined in green, a correct letter in the wrong position will be outlined in yellow, and a incorrect letter will be grayed out.
